# ME433_Advanced-Mechatronics

In this course I learned how to design, solder and debug a printed circuit board (PCB), learn advanced digital communication protocols like SPI, I2C and USB, create physical prototypes with a laser cutter and 3d printer, and interface with an Android device.

## Final Project

## Homeworks

Homework 1:

  Created the breadboard circuit with two LEDs.
  One LED blinks per 0.5 seconds, and the other one has brightness proportional to the value from potentiometer.
