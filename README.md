# ME433_Advanced-Mechatronics

In this course I learned how to 
- Design, solder and debug a printed circuit board (PCB) 
- Program a Microcontroller (PIC32MX250F128B) with the provided IDE
- Communicate with advanced digital protocols like SPI, I2C and USB 
- Create physical prototypes with a laser cutter and 3d printer
- Design a two-wheel vehicle with SolidWorks
- Interface with an Android device.

## Final Project

## Homeworks

* [Homework 1](https://github.com/jongwoo-Lee/ME433_Advanced-Mechatronics/tree/master/HW1):

Created the breadboard circuit with two LEDs.

One LED blinks per 0.5 seconds, and the other one has brightness proportional to the value from potentiometer.

* [Homework 2 and 3](https://github.com/jongwoo-Lee/ME433_Advanced-Mechatronics/tree/master/HW2%263):

Design of printed circuit boards (PCBs) using EAGLE

Photos of my [PCB](https://github.com/jongwoo-Lee/ME433_Advanced-Mechatronics/tree/master/HW2%263) using [mayhewlabs 3d gerber viewer](http://mayhewlabs.com/webGerber/)


* [Homework 4](https://github.com/jongwoo-Lee/ME433_Advanced-Mechatronics/tree/master/HW4):

Made a library of alphabets for OLED display that communicates with I2C protocol

Displayed [Hello world 1337!](https://github.com/jongwoo-Lee/ME433_Advanced-Mechatronics/blob/master/HW4/oled.X/IMG_0221%20copy.jpg) on the display


* [Homework 5](https://github.com/jongwoo-Lee/ME433_Advanced-Mechatronics/tree/master/HW5/accel.X):

Using an accelorometer, the direction and magnitude of the gravity is [shown in the OLED display](https://github.com/jongwoo-Lee/ME433_Advanced-Mechatronics/blob/master/HW5/accel.X/IMG_0223.jpg).

* [Homework 6](https://github.com/Jongwoo-Lee/ME433_Advanced-Mechatronics/tree/master/HW6):

Using the given library "Harmony", the given projects (blinky LED, HID mouse) were customized onto my breadboard.


* Homework 7:

The USB mouse now uses accelorometer as an input, so the mouse moves in the direction of its tilt.
